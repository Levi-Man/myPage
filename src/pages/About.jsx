      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
 
      <span>Hey there! I'm Indra Levi Manahan, living life in Cambridge, ON.</span><br></br> Here's a bit about my journey so far:<br></br>
<span>🎓 Full-Time Student (2020-2022):</span>
<br></br> I recently graduated from the University of the Philippines with a Bachelor's in Architecture. Studying and creating cool stuff were the highlights of those years!<br></br>
<span>📅 Account Manager (2020-2021):</span>
<br></br> During my student days, I juggled roles and worked as an Account Manager for the RCEF Extension Program. Coordinating interviews, managing schedules, and making sure our web TV shows ran smoothly—it was a blast!<br></br>
<span>🍔 FAT Fries and Toppings (2017-2020):</span>
<br></br> Ever heard of FAT Fries and Toppings? Yep, that's mine! I had a blast creating a space that served tasty, budget-friendly food. Recipe testing and managing the crew made it all the more exciting.<br></br>
<span>💼 Campaign Manager (2012-2017):</span>
<br></br> In the corporate world, I was a Campaign Manager. From maintaining client relationships to diving into the nitty-gritty of Google Rich Media campaigns, it was a ride full of challenges and victories.<br></br>
<span>📸 Professional Photographer (2007-2012):</span>
<br></br> Before all that, I had a stint as a photographer. Nikon recognized my work, and I even held seminars on lighting in different countries. My shots graced magazine covers and ad campaigns—good times!<br></br>
<span>🎨 Art Director (2009-2010):</span>
<br></br> Being an Art Director was a wild ride. Juggling dozens of clients, designing websites, and working with an awesome team of designers and developers—it was creative chaos at its finest.<br></br>
<span>🍰 The Chocolate Kiss Café (2005-2008):</span>
<br></br> Remember Chocolate Kiss Café at Roces? I managed that joint, set sales targets, reviewed expenses, and made sure the place vibed with its mission. It was like running a sweet, caffeinated ship!<br></br>
<span>📞 Assistant Team Leader (2003-2005):</span>
<br></br> In the early 2000s, I ventured into managing teams in call centers. From handling escalated calls to coaching agents, it was a rollercoaster of problem-solving and keeping the team spirit alive.<br></br>
<span>🔍 Senior Customer Service Agent (2002-2003):</span>
<br></br> Way back, I was part of the pioneering batch for JVC in the Philippines. Managed calls, trained agents, and dabbled in tech support for Littermaid. Aaah, memories!<br></br>
<span>🏛️ Education at UP:</span>
<br></br> Oh, and did I mention I chaired the U.P. Architecture Forum and headed the Externals Committee? College life was a mix of creative chaos and student leadership!<br></br>
<span>That's a bit about me—always up for a chat or collaboration. Let's connect and share stories!</span>
